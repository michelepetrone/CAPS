# Introduction to computing with Python for engineering and scientific applications

These Jupyter notebooks provide a self-study introduction to computing
with Python. They have been developed for the computing course in Part
IA (Michaelmas Term) of the Engineering Tripos at University of
Cambridge. This is a first computing course for undergraduate students.

The notebooks can be freely used, shared and modified. See the copyright
and license notice below.

## Note to EH2745 version

The versions provided here as part of the course EH2745 Computer applications in power systems are minor modifications to the original, with the major changes being separation of of the files into separate folders with ensuing changes in referencing as needed.

## Getting started

Each notebook covers a topic, with a number of exercises for completion
at the end of each notebook. Start with the notebook [Part IA Michaelmas
Term computing](00%20Part%20IA%20Michaelmas%20Term%20computing.ipynb). 

## Accompanying exercises

For each notebook there are a set of exercises in the directory
[Exercises](./Exercises/) for completion at end the of each Activity
notebook.
